#  \j	                  The number of processes you've suspended in this shell by hitting ^Z
#  \l	                  The name of the shell's terminal device (such as "ttyp4")

#  \r                 	Carriage return
#  \s	                  The name of the shell executable (such as "bash")
#  \t	                  Time in 24-hour format (such as "23:01:01")
#  \T                 	Time in 12-hour format (such as "11:01:01")
#  \@	                  Time in 12-hour format with am/pm
#  \u	                  Your username
#  \v                 	Version of bash (such as 2.04)

#  \[	                  This sequence should appear before a sequence of characters that don't move the cursor (like color escape sequences). This allows bash to calculate word wrapping correctly.
#  \]	                  This sequence should appear after a sequence of non-printing characters.
